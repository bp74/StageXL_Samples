This game was developed with Adobe Flash and later ported to HTML5 by using the
Dart programming language and the StageXL library. The similarity between
ActionScript and Dart made it surprisingly easy to convert the as3-files to
dart-files. The StageXL library provides all the DisplayList and Sound classes
you need to port Flash code. In the end the port of the game only took a few
hours.
